# Changelog

## v0.6-pre
Improved enemy firing solution generation. Take in account that at fire time
they now target bot stats for the previous tick time.

My bot does not anymore slam the brake, when all enemy are dead. Since bullets
are still flying.

Keep track of bots hit rate and hit by others rate

## v0.5
Master bot use position in future to calculate its firing position, thus
correct path prediction of my own bullets. So far I still use only headOn and
linear guns.


## v0.4 - 0.1
lost in history since the frame work was taken from IWillFireNoBullet robot.
So see its version history.

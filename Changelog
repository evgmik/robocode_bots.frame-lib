# Changelog

## v0.5
Master bot use position in future to calculate its firing position, thus
correct path prediction of my own bullets. So far I still use only headOn and
linear guns.


## v0.4 - 0.1
lost in history since the frame work was taken from IWillFireNoBullet robot.
So see its version history.

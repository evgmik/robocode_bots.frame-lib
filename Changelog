# Changelog
TODO: try to increase melee bullet power, HawkOnFire often get more bullet
damage bonus than me.

TODO: make center of the field more dangerous in melee, so bot moves closer to
the wall. simple.Wall has amaizing survival rate, with simple trick. See
voidious.Diamond too.

TODO: count only passed wave when updating firing stats.

TODO: calculate danger of a point according to angle at which all bots are
seen. The smaller the better, since I see all bots with less radar sweeps.

TODO: check linear and circular guns for the check when last points is not
available at the fire request time, so one had to extrapolate to this time.

TODO: guess factor gun

TODO: take in account wave fired by other bots to calculate my guns stats

TODO: ramming attack if guns fail

TODO: chose best firing angle gun, the one which hits most targets

TODO: add random angle offset if bullet shielders like DrussGT are detected

## v1.4
Attempt to reduce gun calculations:
Enemy wave directed at us only if master bot is the closest or number of
enemies >=3. Consequently enemy waves with no dangerous bullet are
disregarded.

Exact path is calculated for longer time period and is not updated evey tick
any more (unless there is a fire detected or minimal path length is reached).

Added Random gun, to the guns array.

## v1.3
Fixed circularGun bug which was triggered in melee, when no consequent points
are available to figure out velocity rotation.

## v1.2
Added circularGun, enemy fires it too

## v1.1

Fixed linear gun: does not offer future positions outside the field
Fixed contribution of enemy energy to the target weight, it use to select 
most energetic enemies.

Redone weight calculations for best target selection, among other things it
takes in account enemy hit rate and fire count only after some amount of
rounds (5) played.

Bot position danger includes its energy.

## v1.0
v0.7 - 0.9 are skipped since v1.0 has quite drastic changes.

Enemy fires a wave to everyone (might be too CPU intensive).

Do not fire enemy wave if its energy drop is due to the master bot hit.

Count guns success stats.

Chose gun according to its virtual hit probability.

Chose target according to distance, energy, hit probability, survival stats, etc.

Fix a bug: did not detect a bullet with energy very close to 0.1, Diamond
likes to fire such one close to the end of melee.

## v0.6
Improved enemy firing solution generation. Take in account that at fire time
they now target bot stats for the previous tick time.

My bot does not anymore slam the brake, when all enemy are dead. Since bullets
are still flying.

Keep track of bots hit rate and hit by others rate.

Longer default danger path prediction (8 -> 32) should help against rammers



## v0.5
Master bot use position in future to calculate its firing position, thus
correct path prediction of my own bullets. So far I still use only headOn and
linear guns.


## v0.4 - 0.1
lost in history since the frame work was taken from IWillFireNoBullet robot.
So see its version history.

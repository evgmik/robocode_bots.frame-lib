# Changelog
TODO: try to increase melee bullet power, HawkOnFire often get more bullet
damage bonus than me.

TODO: make center of the field more dangerous in melee, so bot moves closer to
the wall. simple.Wall has amaizing survival rate, with simple trick. See
voidious.Diamond too.

TODO: count only passed wave when updating firing stats.

TODO: calculate danger of a point according to angle at which all bots are
seen. The smaller the better, since I see all bots with less radar sweeps.

TODO: check linear and circular guns for the check when last points is not
available at the fire request time, so one had to extrapolate to this time.

TODO: make enemy bots fire guess factor gun at the master bot

TODO: take in account wave fired by other bots to calculate my guns stats

TODO: ramming attack if guns fail

TODO: chose best firing angle gun, the one which hits most targets

TODO: calculate new variants of the path on every tick, instead of numerous
trial on a single tick, which leads to skipped turns.

TODO: do not spend cycles on gun when gun is too hot to fire.

TODO: increase bullet power in 1on1 to something like 1500/dist. Survival
bonus is small but bullet bonus is increases with bullet energy. So it better
aim for higher bullet damage than survival bonus.

TODO: see why in melee, the bot likes to sit still near the wall or conner, it
start to happen near v1.5. Looks it due to changes introduced in v1.4
May be add maximum staying time in a given point. Looks like survival in melee
is a bit worse for v1.4 than for v1.3

TODO: see why bot does not fire when energy drops below 1. Usually, it does
not fire when remaining energy is 0.6

TODO: take in account guess factor stats collected by other bots

TODO: enemy bot fire guess factor at me

TODO: move enemy firing logic to enemy gunManager

## v1.7-pre

## v1.6

Radar locks on target when gun is cold enough.
Gun aiming is not executed when gun is too hot.
Added guess factor gun for the master bot gun array. Apparently, in the old
EbBot the guess factor gun did not take in account the lateral velocity
direction. So this realization should outperform it.

Optimization:do not calculate path danger if it is already greater than a
known path. This should reduce CPU usage.

## v1.5

Added bullet shielders detection, and fire with offset to circumvent it.
If bot hit enemy bullet, then enemy wave which carries this bullet is removed,
since it has no danger.

Exact path is attempting to find a better path every turn, but with smaller
number of trials than full search.

All very, strange. Melee score went up, but 1on1 down.
Apparently, increasing maximalPathLength to 50 from 32. makes 1on1 motion more
predictable. Will reduce it to see the difference. Checked, looks like it does not
change anything. Maybe it because path was recalculated every tick.

Looking closely at some battles for the v1.3, I conclude that there were a
glitch in the rumble. When run locally with gui, I do not get stellar 100%
survival against bots which rumble reported as such. For example against
zyx.micro.Ant 1.1. The scores also not so awful for the v1.4 as in the rumble.


## v1.4
Attempt to reduce gun calculations:
Enemy wave directed at us only if master bot is the closest or number of
enemies >=3. Consequently enemy waves with no dangerous bullet are
disregarded.

Exact path is calculated for longer time period and is not updated evey tick
any more (unless there is a fire detected or minimal path length is reached).

Added Random gun, to the guns array.

## v1.3
Fixed circularGun bug which was triggered in melee, when no consequent points
are available to figure out velocity rotation.

## v1.2
Added circularGun, enemy fires it too

## v1.1

Fixed linear gun: does not offer future positions outside the field
Fixed contribution of enemy energy to the target weight, it use to select 
most energetic enemies.

Redone weight calculations for best target selection, among other things it
takes in account enemy hit rate and fire count only after some amount of
rounds (5) played.

Bot position danger includes its energy.

## v1.0
v0.7 - 0.9 are skipped since v1.0 has quite drastic changes.

Enemy fires a wave to everyone (might be too CPU intensive).

Do not fire enemy wave if its energy drop is due to the master bot hit.

Count guns success stats.

Chose gun according to its virtual hit probability.

Chose target according to distance, energy, hit probability, survival stats, etc.

Fix a bug: did not detect a bullet with energy very close to 0.1, Diamond
likes to fire such one close to the end of melee.

## v0.6
Improved enemy firing solution generation. Take in account that at fire time
they now target bot stats for the previous tick time.

My bot does not anymore slam the brake, when all enemy are dead. Since bullets
are still flying.

Keep track of bots hit rate and hit by others rate.

Longer default danger path prediction (8 -> 32) should help against rammers



## v0.5
Master bot use position in future to calculate its firing position, thus
correct path prediction of my own bullets. So far I still use only headOn and
linear guns.


## v0.4 - 0.1
lost in history since the frame work was taken from IWillFireNoBullet robot.
So see its version history.

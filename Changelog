# Changelog

TODO: count only passed wave when updating firing stats.

TODO: calculate danger of a point according to angle at which all bots are
seen. The smaller the better, since I see all bots with less radar sweeps.

TODO: circular factor gun

TODO: guess factor gun

TODO: random  gun

TODO: take in account wave fired by other bots to calculate my guns stats

TODO: chose best firing angle gun, the one which hits most targets

## v1.1 - pre

Fixed linear gun: does not offer future positions outside the field

Redone weight calculations for best target selection, among other things it
takes in account enemy hit rate and fire count only after some amount of
rounds (5) played.

Bot position danger includes its energy.

## v1.0
v0.7 - 0.9 are skipped since v1.0 has quite drastic changes.

Enemy fires a wave to everyone (might be too CPU intensive).

Do not fire enemy wave if its energy drop is due to the master bot hit.

Count guns success stats.

Chose gun according to its virtual hit probability.

Chose target according to distance, energy, hit probability, survival stats, etc.

Fix a bug: did not detect a bullet with energy very close to 0.1, Diamond
likes to fire such one close to the end of melee.

## v0.6
Improved enemy firing solution generation. Take in account that at fire time
they now target bot stats for the previous tick time.

My bot does not anymore slam the brake, when all enemy are dead. Since bullets
are still flying.

Keep track of bots hit rate and hit by others rate.

Longer default danger path prediction (8 -> 32) should help against rammers



## v0.5
Master bot use position in future to calculate its firing position, thus
correct path prediction of my own bullets. So far I still use only headOn and
linear guns.


## v0.4 - 0.1
lost in history since the frame work was taken from IWillFireNoBullet robot.
So see its version history.
